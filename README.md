# qSim-cpp

I'm building this to learn *C++* and *Quantum Information Theory* simultaneously, so don't be surprised if they're both wrong. Instead, feel free to [create a new issue](https://github.com/haykkh/qSim-cpp/issues/new) or a [new pull request](https://github.com/haykkh/qSim-cpp/pull/new/master) so you can rub in exactly what I did wrong in a concise, well commented manner.

Thanks x
